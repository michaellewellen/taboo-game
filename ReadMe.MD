## Taboo Word Game
This code is being made in cooperation with Claude.AI to teach me how to use Node.JS.  It will hopefully turn into a good family game where we can generate cards based on the original game from the 90s. 

- Local network.  This will create the back end server to support the game on my lap top using a locally defined network.  It will identify the network the computer is currently connected to, and create a QR code so other players can connect to the same network 
- Each device will then connect to the game server and run front end on their devices for the game play
